									<p>Goal: Create a proof-of-concept prototype for our pin actuation design</p>

								<h3>Mechanical</h3>
								<p>Our main goal in Sprint 1 was to create proof-of-concept components for a single braille cell. We wanted to make sure that we could push up the pins to form braille dots, and use magnets to lock them into position. To accomplish these goals, we created two separate prototypes. </p>
								<p>Our main goal in Sprint 1 was to create proof-of-concept components for a single braille cell. We wanted to make sure that we could push up the pins to form braille dots, and use magnets to lock them into position. To accomplish these goals, we created two separate prototypes. </p>
								<h4>Prototype 1</h4>
								<p>The first prototype was designed to test the feasibility of using a cam to push up a row of pins. It contained one braille cell (a 3D-printed block with six holes in it for braille pins), some braille pins (also 3D-printed), one cam (laser cut from clear acrylic) connected to a servo motor, and a housing that held everything together. Shown below is an image of the prototype with individual parts labeled.</p>

								<p>As we made these prototypes, we realized that our 3D printers did not have high enough resolution to accurately print the pins. The pins that were printed had a tendency to jam in their holes. Looking forward, we decided to find a part to use for the pins that would move more smoothly in the cell holes.</p>
								<p>To figure out the cam geometry, we made a few design iterations: first using cardboard and then using acrylic and the laser cutter so we could test a number of designs at one. The cam design shown in the prototype above has a 4mm travel distance, which was enough to move the pins up.</p>
								<p>We decided to focus on braille cells with a 2x3 dot pattern, instead of the 8-dot pattern (2x4) often used in refreshable braille displays (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille#Eight-dot_braille">Wikipedia - Braille</a>). Our design doesn't allow us to properly utilise the extra row that's used to indicate cursor position and other information about interacting with a webpage.</p>
								<p>Maintaining the proper dimensions for a braille cell is crucial to reader comprehension. However, braille is very small. To work around this, we decided to scale up the cells and related components by a factor of 2 so we could easily source parts. This allowed us to maintain the ratios between the dimensions of a braille cell while working on a design that was larger and easier to manufacture.</p>

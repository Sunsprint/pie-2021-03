									<p>We started our project wanting to create something interactive that combines software complexity,
										opportunity for visual design, and mechanical/electrical challenges.
										We wanted to make something that we would be proud of at the end of the project, and most importantly,
										we wanted to provide a <b>fun</b> and <b>cool</b> experience for users.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>We ended up deciding to make a chessboard. We wanted to be able to play single player chess against
										a computer as if it were a human. This meant having a physical chessboard 
										(as opposed to a virtual one) and integrating a way for the computer to
										detect the state of the board and move pieces. This included using an electromagnet
										and a camera. </p>

							<h2>System</h2>
							<p>maybe add something here</p>
						</header>
						<p>Our project consists of several integrated systems: a 2D gantry 
							that moved an electromagnet underneath the board, 3D printed
							chess pieces with magnets on the bottom, an actual chess box,
							and a computer AI that could see moves with a camera and control
							the electromagnet to move its own pieces. We focused on visual
							design as well as functionality, and this took the form of an
							arcade-like color theme and lights.</p>

							<h2>Project Origins</h2>
							<p>
							</p>
						</header>
						<p> After discussing various ideas, we were inspired by the 2014 Harry Potter style Wizards Chess team and
							decided to iterate upon their POE project. We were fans of the hidden electromagnet that makes the chess pieces
							move on its own, but wanted to take a different approach on the visual theme. Our software team
							was more interested in implementing a chess AI and learning about computer vision than spending time with
							voice recognition technology.

							<h2>Meet Our Team</h2>
							<p> We are team Grandmaster, a group of 5 sophomores at <b><a href="https://www.olin.edu/">
								Olin College of Engineering</a></b>.
								We have interests ranging from robotics, sustainability, mechanical design, material science, and visual design!</p>

									<h3>Arla Sutton</h3>
									<p>Arla's an Engineering: Design major interested in Mechanical Design, and helped to fill the shoes of a
										mechanical engineer for this project. She focused primarily on creating a working gantry, cutting the
										pieces for the box, and crafting a comprehensive Solidworks assembly.  Arla has defeated her dad in chess
										a whopping total of three times over the course of her life, an accomplishment she takes great pride in.  </p>

									<h3>Ari Porad</h3>
									<p>As a robotics-focused Engineering: Computing major, Ari is a lover of all things software and most things
										 robotic. He loved building the software that powers the Grandmaster Chess Board, especially getting to 
										 tightly integrate the physical and virtual.

									<p>The truest opossum of the group, Emma fills the other ⅝ of  a mechanical engineer’s shoes. They are majoring
										in Engineering: Sustainability and are always excited to do hands-on projects, learn new things, work with
										cool people, and talk about Star Wars.</p>

									<h3>Dre Hilton</h3>
									<p>Half Electrical and Computer Engineering major, Half Chemical/Matsci Engineering major, Dre was just as
										enthused to be the team's electrical engineer for this project as he is about binge watching anime,
										cartoons, and docuseries! In his youth, Dre played chess with his uncle and grand dad, so this project
										was extremely refreshing to work on.

									<h3>Claire Hashizume</h3>
									<p>Claire is planning to major in Human-centered Design Engineering and loves to make things pretty. Despite 
										not knowing how to play chess (and having no plans to learn), she was very excited to work on the visual design of this project, and she spent her
										time building the website and helping to laser cut parts. </p>

									<h3>Computer AI</h3>
									<p>Throughout the duration of the project, our computer chess algorithm learned how to use the camera to check where the location of the pieces and to use
										 the stepper motor gantry system to make basic chess moves. In the future, the computer hopes to learn to make more difficult moves such as move knights,
										  make captures, and castle so that it can win a game.

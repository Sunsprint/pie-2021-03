								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span><h4>Grant Miner</h4>Grant did not have any experience working with stepper motors before this project, so elected to take on learning about motors, their drivers, and libraries. After burning out multiple motor drivers, he finally relented and read the datasheets. He also wanted to learn more about HTML and supported Evelyn on the website development. He also developed some impressive dexterity with hex keys.</p>

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span><h4>Ishaan Oberoi</h4>Ishaan is someone that loves spending time in CAD to design mechanisms that move. On this project, he worked mainly on the mechanical design, creating the linear motion components, the belt and pulley system, and the turret mechanism. He loved the challenge of spending as little as possible on mechanical design and using as many resources such as scrap material, going through the freecycle, and 3D printing to make this project a reality. </p>

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span><h4>Evelyn Kessler</h4>Before this project Evelyn didnâ€™t know what a camera slider was. After some quick googling, they caught up and got started on the wiring and coding of the user interface. They pivoted multiple times in response to technical difficulties with multiple different LCD displays, until they eventually triumphed and along with Annika delivered a touch screen interface. They also employed their HTML experience to create this website.</p>


								<hr />

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span><h4>Annika Pfister</h4>Annika was interested in learning about user interfaces and getting some tangential exposure to mechanical design. She focused on iterating through LCD screens to a final touch screen product with Evelyn, and gained a lot of experience working with Adafruit libraries in Arduino. She also now understands how a basic gantry works.</p>

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span><h4>Andrew DeCandia</h4>Andrew bit off a bit more than he could chew this semester at Olin. Despite this, Andrew learned what an optocoupler is when he added the shutter trigger electronics and practiced his CAD skills designing the screen, arduino, and breadboard mount. He even went so far as to email adafruit the correct dimensions to some of the parts the team was working with. He is also the main photographer of the group, and took most of the before and after camera footage. </p>

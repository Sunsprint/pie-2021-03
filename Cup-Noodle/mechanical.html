								<!-- First feature -->
								
								<h3> 2-axis Vertical Gantry </h3>	
								<p class='tab'> Our finalized gantry is composed of aluminum 80-20 rails, custom 3D printed mounts, wooden housing, and three Nema 17 motors to control GT2 Timing belt pulleys Two motors controlled the y-axis movement and one controlled the x-axis movement.  <br/> </p>

								<p class='tab'> Our gantry is 3 ft by 4 ft by 2 ft. We wanted to make it large to be as close to a real vending machine as possible. <br/></p>

                                <div class="image fit"><img src="images/mechanical-2.jpg" alt="" /></div>

                                <hr/>
								
                                <!-- Second feature -->
								
								<h3> Housing </h3>	
								<p class='tab'> We have a wooden housing supporting our gantry system and ramen dispensers. Our backboard is composed of an old air hockey table and we have open sides and an open front. We have two wooden boards that the four cup ramen dispensers are screwed into, as well as two wooden boards on each side to close off our machine.
                                </p>

                                <hr/>

                                <!-- Third feature -->
								
								<h3> Cup Dispensing </h3>	
								<p class='tab'> Our cup dispensing mechanism is made of wood, with rails on either side to guide our cup ramen. We spiraled wire made from clothing hangers that we found to be stiff enough to push our ramen forward.</p>

                                <p class='tab'>  To spin our wire, we are using the same motors provided by PIE for our line following robot. We found these can provide enough force to push the ramen forward when set to at least 60 speed. </p>
                                

                                <div class="image fit"><img src="images/mechanical-3.jpg" alt="" /></div>
                                <hr/>


                                <!-- Fourth feature -->


                                <h3> Hot Water </h3>	
								<p class='tab'> Regarding our hot water, we currently have a bulkhead screwed into the side of our kettle. A valve is connected to our bulkhead, with a stepper motor turning the valve to open and close it. We have a copper toilet riser to pour the water into the cup, which we cut and sharpened. </p>


                                <p class="tab">  We had an issue with our valves as the first valve required more torque than the stepper motor could provide. We needed to find a new valve that was still food-safe, easy to turn, and could withstand hot water, and found a valve used for sinks that works very well.</p>
                               
                         
                                <!-- That's how the young folk do well -->
                                <div class="image fit"><img src="images/mechanical-4.jpg" alt="" /></div>
                                
                                <p class="tab"> Our first version of our kettle and valve setup included rubber piping to connect our valve to our boba straw. We were not able to test this setup since the valve was too stiff to turn with our stepper motor. </p>
                                
                                <div class="image fit"><img src="images/mechanical-5.jpg" alt="" /></div>

                                <p class="tab"> The second version of our valve setup is much more successful. Since the valve is a lot easier to turn, the stepper motor can successfully open and close it. There is no need for rubber piping as the valve connects to our makeshift straw at a 90 degree angle. </p>

                                <hr/>
                                
                                <!-- Fith feature -->
                                <h3> Topping</h3>	
								<p class='tab'> Our topping dispensing system was 3D printed with a servo motor to spin the inner portion of our dispenser, which is meant to allow toppings to drop onto our cup. We had issues with assembling our mechanism and having toppings drop reliably, so we decided to table topping dispensers until later. </p>


                                <p> List of motors: </p>

                                    <ul>3 Nema 17 motors (gantry)</ul>
                                    <ul>1 stepper motor (valve)</ul>
                                    <ul>4 DC motors (cup dispensers)</ul>
